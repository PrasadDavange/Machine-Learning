       " \n",
       " by Ambrose Bierce\n",
       " , I\n",
       " , A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down\n",
       " into the swift water twenty feet below.  , The man's hands were behind, his back, the wrists bound with a cord.  , A rope closely encircled his\n",
       " neck.  , It was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and, the\n",
       " slack fell to the level of his knees.  , Some loose boards laid upon the\n",
       " ties supporting the rails of the railway supplied a footing for him\n",
       " and his executioners--two private soldiers of the Federal army,\n",
       " directed by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy\n",
       " sheriff.  , At a short remove upon the same temporary platform was an\n",
       " officer in the uniform of his rank, armed.  , He was a captain.  , A\n",
       " sentinel at each end of the bridge stood with his rifle in the\n",
       " position known as \"support,\" that is to say, vertical in front of the\n",
       " left shoulder, the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight\n",
       " across the chest--a formal and unnatural position, enforcing an erect\n",
       " carriage of the body.  , It did not appear to be the duty of these two\n",
       " men to know what was occurring at the center of the bridge; they\n",
       " merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that traversed it.\n",
       " , Beyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran\n",
       " straight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving,, was\n",
       " lost to view.  , Doubtless there was an outpost farther along.  , The\n",
       " other bank of the stream was open ground--a gentle slope topped with\n",
       " a stockade of vertical tree trunks, loopholed for rifles, with a\n",
       " single embrasure through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon\n",
       " commanding the bridge.  , Midway up the slope between the bridge and\n",
       " fort were the spectators--a single company of infantry in line, at\n",
       " \"parade rest,\" the butts of their rifles on the ground, the barrels\n",
       " inclining slightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands\n",
       " crossed upon the stock., A lieutenant stood at the right of the line,\n",
       " the point of his sword upon the ground, his left hand resting upon his\n",
       " right.  , Excepting the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a\n",
       " man moved.  , The company faced the bridge, staring stonily, motionless., The sentinels, facing the banks of the stream, might have been statues\n",
       " to adorn the bridge.  , The captain stood with folded arms, silent,\n",
       " observing the work of his subordinates, but making no sign., Death is a\n",
       " dignitary who when he comes announced is to be received with formal\n",
       " manifestations of respect, even by those most familiar with him.  , In\n",
       " the code of military etiquette silence and fixity are forms of\n",
       " deference.\n",
       " , The man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about\n",
       " thirty-five years of age.  , He was a civilian, if one might judge from\n",
       " his habit, which was that of a planter.  , His features were good--a\n",
       " straight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark\n",
       " hair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar\n",
       " of his well fitting frock coat.  , He wore a moustache and pointed\n",
       " beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a\n",
       " kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose\n",
       " neck was in the hemp.  , Evidently this was no vulgar assassin.  , The\n",
       " liberal military code makes provision for hanging many kinds of\n",
       " persons, and gentlemen are not excluded.\n",
       " , The preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped\n",
       " aside and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing., The sergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself\n",
       " immediately behind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace., These movements left the condemned man and the sergeant standing on\n",
       " the two ends of the same plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties\n",
       " of the bridge.  , The end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not\n",
       " quite, reached a fourth.  , This plank had been held in place by the\n",
       " weight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant.  , At a\n",
       " signal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would\n",
       " tilt and, the condemned man go down between two ties.  , The arrangement\n",
       " commended itself to his judgement as simple and effective.  , His face\n",
       " had not been covered nor his eyes bandaged.  , He looked a moment at his\n",
       " \"unsteadfast footing,\" then let his gaze wander to the swirling water\n",
       " of the stream racing madly beneath his feet., A piece of dancing\n",
       " driftwood caught his attention and his eyes followed it down the\n",
       " current.  , How slowly it appeared to move!  , What a sluggish stream!\n",
       " , He closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and\n",
       " children.  , The water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brooding\n",
       " mists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the\n",
       " soldiers, the piece of drift--all had distracted him.  , And now he\n",
       " became conscious of a new disturbance.  , Striking through the thought\n",
       " of his dear ones was sound, which he could neither ignore nor\n",
       " understand,, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of\n",
       " a blacksmith's hammer upon the anvil, ; it had the same ringing quality., He wondered what it was, and whether immeasurably distant or near by--\n",
       " it seemed both.  , Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the\n",
       " tolling of a death knell.  , He awaited each new stroke with impatience, and--he knew not why--, apprehension.  , The intervals of silence grew\n",
       " progressively longer; the delays became maddening.  , With their greater\n",
       " infrequency the sounds increased in strength and sharpness.  , They hurt, his ear like the thrust of a knife, ; he feared he would shriek.  , What he\n",
       " heard was the ticking of his watch.\n",
       " , He unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him.  , \"If I could\n",
       " free my hands,\" he thought, \"I might throw off the noose and spring\n",
       " into the stream.  , By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming\n",
       " vigorously, reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home.  , My\n",
       " home, thank God, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little\n",
       " ones are still beyond the invader's farthest advance.\"\n",
       " , As these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were\n",
       " flashed into the doomed man's brain rather than evolved from it the\n",
       " captain nodded to the sergeant.  , The sergeant stepped aside.\n",
       " , II\n",
       " , Peyton Farquhar was a well to do planter, of an old and highly\n",
       " respected Alabama family.  , Being a slave owner and like other slave, owners, a politician, he was naturally an original secessionist and\n",
       " ardently devoted to the Southern cause.  , Circumstances of an imperious\n",
       " nature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from\n",
       " taking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous\n",
       " campaigns ending with the fall of Corinth, and he chafed under the\n",
       " inglorious restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the\n",
       " larger life of the soldier, the opportunity for distinction.  , That, opportunity, he felt, would come, as it comes to all in wartime., Meanwhile he did what he could.  , No service was too humble for him to\n",
       " perform in the aid of the South,, no adventure too perilous for him to\n",
       " undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at\n",
       " heart, a soldier, and who in good faith and without too much\n",
       " qualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous\n",
       " dictum that all is fair in love and war.\n",
       " , One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench\n",
       " near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the\n",
       " gate and asked for a drink of water., Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy\n",
       " to serve him with her own white hands.  , While she was fetching the\n",
       " water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly\n",
       " for news from the front.\n",
       " , \"The Yanks are repairing the railroads,\" said the man, \"and are\n",
       " getting ready for another advance.  , They have reached the Owl Creek\n",
       " bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank.  , The\n",
       " commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring\n",
       " that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges,\n",
       " tunnels, or trains will be summarily hanged.  , I saw the order., \"\n",
       " , \"How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?\" Farquhar asked.\n",
       " , \"About thirty miles., \"\n",
       " , \"Is there no force on this side of the creek?\"\n",
       " , \"Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single\n",
       " sentinel at this end of the bridge., \"\n",
       " , \"Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the\n",
       " picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,\" said\n",
       " Farquhar, smiling, \"what could he accomplish?, \"\n",
       " , The soldier reflected.  , \"I was there a month ago,\" he replied.  , \"I\n",
       " observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of\n",
       " driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge.  , It is\n",
       " now dry and would burn like tinder.\"\n",
       " , The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank., He\n",
       " thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away.  , An\n",
       " hour later, after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going, northward in the direction from which he had come.  , He was a Federal\n",
       " scout.\n",
       " , III\n",
       " , As Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost\n",
       " consciousness and was as one already dead., From this state he was\n",
       " awakened--ages later, it seemed to him--by the pain of a sharp\n",
       " pressure upon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation.  , Keen,\n",
       " poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every\n",
       " fiber of his body and limbs.  , These pains appeared to flash along well\n",
       " defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid\n",
       " periodicity.  , They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him\n",
       " to an intolerable temperature.  , As to his head, he was conscious of\n",
       " nothing but a feeling of fullness--of congestion.  , These sensations\n",
       " were unaccompanied by thought.  , The intellectual part of his nature\n",
       " was already effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was\n",
       " torment.  , He was conscious of motion., Encompassed in a luminous cloud,\n",
       " of which he was now merely the fiery heart, without material, substance, he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a\n",
       " vast pendulum.  , Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light\n",
       " about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful\n",
       " roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark.  , The power of\n",
       " thought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had\n",
       " fallen into the stream.  , There was no additional strangulation; the\n",
       " noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water\n",
       " from his lungs.  , To die of hanging at the bottom of a river!--the idea, seemed to him ludicrous.  , He opened his eyes in the darkness and saw\n",
       " above him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible!  , He was\n",
       " still sinking, for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a\n",
       " mere glimmer.  , Then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he\n",
       " was rising toward the surface--knew it with reluctance, for he was now\n",
       " very comfortable.  , \"To be hanged and drowned,\" he thought, \"that is\n",
       " not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot.  , No, ; I will not be shot;\n",
       " that is not fair.\"\n",
       " , He was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist\n",
       " apprised him that he was trying to free his hands.  , He gave the\n",
       " struggle his attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a\n",
       " juggler, without interest in the outcome.  , What splendid effort!--what, magnificent,, what superhuman strength!  , Ah, that was a fine endeavor!, Bravo!  , The cord fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the\n",
       " hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light.  , He watched them\n",
       " with a new interest as first one, and then the other pounced upon the\n",
       " noose at his neck.  , They tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside,\n",
       " its undulations resembling those of a water snake.  , \"Put it back, put\n",
       " it back!\"  , He thought he shouted these words to his hands, for the\n",
       " undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had\n",
       " yet experienced.  , His neck ached horribly; his brain was on fire, his\n",
       " heart, which had been fluttering faintly, gave a great leap, trying to\n",
       " force itself out at his mouth.  , His whole body was racked and wrenched\n",
       " with an insupportable anguish!, But his disobedient hands gave no heed\n",
       " to the command.  , They beat the water vigorously with quick, downward\n",
       " strokes, forcing him to the surface.  , He felt his head emerge; his\n",
       " eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest expanded convulsively,\n",
       " and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs engulfed a great\n",
       " draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a shriek!\n",
       " , He was now in full possession of his physical senses.  , They were,\n",
       " indeed, preternaturally keen and alert.  , Something in the awful\n",
       " disturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that\n",
       " they made record of things never before perceived.  , He felt the\n",
       " ripples upon his face and heard their separate sounds as they struck., He looked at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual\n",
       " trees, the leaves and the veining of each leaf, --he saw the very\n",
       " insects upon them:  the locusts, the brilliant bodied flies, the gray\n",
       " spiders stretching their webs from twig to twig.  , He noted the\n",
       " prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million blades of grass., The humming of the gnats that danced above the eddies of the stream,\n",
       " the beating of the dragon flies' wings, the strokes of the water\n",
       " spiders' legs, like oars which had lifted their boat--all these made\n",
       " audible music.  , A fish slid along beneath his eyes, and he heard the\n",
       " rush of its body parting the water.\n",
       " , He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the\n",
       " visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point,\n",
       " and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the\n",
       " captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners.  , They were\n",
       " in silhouette against the blue sky.  , They shouted and gesticulated,\n",
       " pointing at him.  , The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire;\n",
       " the others were unarmed.  , Their movements were grotesque and horrible,\n",
       " their forms gigantic.\n",
       " , Suddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water\n",
       " smartly within a few inches of his head, spattering his face with\n",
       " spray.  , He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with\n",
       " his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the\n",
       " muzzle.  , The man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge\n",
       " gazing into his own through the sights of the rifle.  , He observed that\n",
       " it was a gray eye and remembered having read that gray eyes were\n",
       " keenest, and that all famous marksmen had them., Nevertheless, this one\n",
       " had missed.\n",
       " , A counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was\n",
       " again looking at the forest on the bank opposite the fort.  , The sound\n",
       " of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind\n",
       " him and came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and, subdued all other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears., Although no soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread\n",
       " significance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the\n",
       " lieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning's work.  , How\n",
       " coldly and pitilessly--with what an even, calm intonation, presaging,\n",
       " and enforcing tranquility in the men--with what accurately measured\n",
       " interval fell those cruel words:\n",
       " \n",
       " \"Company! . . ., Attention! ., . ., Shoulder arms! ., . ., Ready!., . ., Aim! . . ., Fire!\"\n",
       " , Farquhar dived--dived as deeply as he could.  , The water roared in his\n",
       " ears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dull thunder of the\n",
       " volley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bits of\n",
       " metal, singularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward.  , Some of\n",
       " them touched him on the face and hands, then fell away, continuing\n",
       " their descent., One lodged between his collar and neck; it was\n",
       " uncomfortably warm and he snatched it out.\n",
       " , As he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been\n",
       " a long time under water; he was perceptibly farther downstream--, nearer\n",
       " to safety.  , The soldiers had almost finished reloading; the metal\n",
       " ramrods flashed all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from\n",
       " the barrels, turned in the air, and thrust into their sockets.  , The\n",
       " two sentinels fired again, independently and ineffectually.\n",
       " , The hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming\n",
       " vigorously with the current.  , His brain was as energetic as his arms\n",
       " and legs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning:\n",
       " , \"The officer,\" he reasoned, \"will not make that martinet's error a\n",
       " second time.  , It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot.  , He\n",
